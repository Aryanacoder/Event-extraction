## Introduction
Effective disaster management relies on the rapid acquisition and interpretation of event-related information. This framework leverages the vast amounts of real-time data available from online news and social media platforms to provide timely and accurate insights. By integrating advanced NLP models like BERT, RoBERTa, and BART, along with geospatial analysis and sentiment scoring, this system aims to enhance situational awareness and support informed decision-making during disaster response efforts.

## Features
- **Data Acquisition**: Automated ingestion of data from Google News RSS feeds and Twitter API.
- **Text Preprocessing**: HTML stripping, noise reduction, normalization, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extraction of key entities using Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa).
- **Geocoding**: Conversion of location names to geographic coordinates using Nominatim.
- **Event Classification**: Zero-shot classification using BART for flexible event categorization.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assessment of public sentiment using the VADER model.
- **Severity Scoring**: Calculation of composite severity scores based on extracted impact metrics.
- **Event Clustering**: Grouping of related reports using algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative, and HDBSCAN.
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps and temporal plots for visualizing results.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disaster-event-extraction.git
   cd disaster-event-extraction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - Obtain API keys for Google News RSS and Twitter API.
   - Place the keys in the appropriate configuration files or environment variables as specified in the `config.py` file.

4. **Download Pre-trained Models**:
   - Ensure you have access to pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, and BART. These can be downloaded from the Hugging Face Model Hub.

## Usage
1. **Run the Data Acquisition Script**:
   ```bash
   python data_acquisition.py
   ```

2. **Process and Analyze Data**:
   ```bash
   python process_data.py
   ```

3. **Visualize Results**:
   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py
   ```

## Results
The framework processes high-velocity data streams, identifies disaster hotspots, groups related reports, and provides actionable intelligence through interactive visualizations. Hypothetical results demonstrate the system's capacity to handle moderate data streams and accurately classify disaster events.

## Challenges and Limitations
- **Data Quality and Noise**: Social media data is often noisy and contains misinformation.
- **NER Accuracy**: Extracting precise locations and impact figures from unstructured text remains challenging.
- **Geocoding Ambiguity**: Ambiguous place names require contextual disambiguation.
- **Zero-Shot Classification Limits**: Performance depends on the chosen pre-trained model and label formulation.
- **Severity Score Limitations**: Reliance on explicit mention of impact figures.
- **Clustering Complexity**: Defining optimal feature space and distance metrics.
- **Scalability and Real-Time Constraints**: Efficient code and robust infrastructure are essential.

## Future Work
- **Multimodal Data Integration**: Incorporate images, videos, and satellite imagery.
- **Improved Disambiguation**: Develop sophisticated disambiguation techniques.
- **Advanced Temporal Analysis**: Implement event forecasting models.
- **Cross-lingual Capabilities**: Extend the framework to handle multiple languages.
- **Fact-Checking and Misinformation Detection**: Integrate credibility assessment modules.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Enable continuous learning through expert feedback.
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Explore federated learning for data sharing.
